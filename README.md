# TreeHouse Interface
TreeHouse is a webtool designed to provide property owners with a more holistic and data-driven valuation of their private estates. In addition to valuating resale property, a historic comparison of prices and evaluation of the associated resale market is also provided to allow for a more in depth understanding of the predicted valuation. Currently, the interface only targets resale Apartments, Condominiums and Executive Condominiums with a leasehold tenure within Singapore. 

# Technical Details
For the valuation of resale property, the interface takes in location information in the form of a <b>postal code</b>, as well as additional property specifications such as <b>property type</b>, <b>floor number</b> of unit, <b>floor area</b> in square foot, and <b>remaining lease</b>. The location information is then used to derive other critical details for consideration: 
- Distance to the closest school
- Access to the different MRT lines within a 1km radius
- Distance to nearest MRT station
- Average crime rate within the area

These information are then fed into our pre-trained and pre-tuned <b>XGBoost Regressor</b> which predicts <b>unit price ($ PSM)</b> with a performance of: 
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 4.31%
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 794.80
